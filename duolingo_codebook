Duolingo Codebook (Jenny Do)

Here is a full copy of the codebook; exposure to these variables will helpful for this report: 

(In format: Definition (variable type)). 

* `difficulty_rating` - generated from a ratio of `history_correct` over `history_seen`, it acts as a measure of accuracy for a specific word over all sessions for a particular user and word (unique to each language). Note that since there were multiple users studying the same word for the same language, we took an average over all the words that were the same. In addition, `difficulty_rating` is a percentage that indicates harder difficulty at lower percentages and easier difficulty at higher percentages. More information can be found in the "Creating Difficulty" section (numeric, percentage).

* `p_recall` - proportion of exercises from this lesson/practice where the word/lexeme was correctly recalled (numeric, percentage). 

* `delta` - time (in seconds) since the last lesson/practice that included this word/lexeme (numeric). 

* `learning_language` - language being learned (factor). 

* `lexeme_string` - lexeme tag, in the following format surface-form/lemma<pos>[<modifiers>...] (factor). 

* `surface_form` - refers to the inflected form seen in (or intended for) the exercise (factor). 

* `lemma` is the uninflected root (factor). 

* `pos` is the high-level part of speech, and each of the modifers encodes a morphological component specific to the surface form (tense, gender, person, case, etc.) (factor). 

* `history_seen` - total times user has seen the word/lexeme prior to this lesson/practice (numeric). 

* `history_correct` - total times user has been correct for the word/lexeme prior to this lesson/practice (numeric). 

* `session_seen` - times the user saw the word/lexeme during this lesson/practice (numeric). 

* `session_correct` - times the user got the word/lexeme correct during this lesson/practice (numeric).
